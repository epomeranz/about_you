About you inteview App by Eric Pomeranz Ritter

## Getting Started

This project is a small code test for about you.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

* The project was tested only in android phones
* Only a few Unit test tests were wrote as a demo
* It includes two json files with name
  * assets/json/contacts.json (provided by About you)
  * assets/json/contacts_large.json (a much larger file to test pagination and performance)

if you want to switch between the provided list of contacts and the large one you can do so [here (direct github link)](https://github.com/epomeranz/about_you/blob/882f5c03a086f1ea89bdf7239aa303f6ac3cae89/lib/core/services/db/user_snippets_db_Service_mockup.dart#L10)
* lib/core/services/db/user_snippets_db_Service_mockup.dart#L10
